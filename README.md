# internet-connection-checker
Two Powershell scripts that keep track of internet (or actually Google) connection status. The simple version just opens a popup saying you're connected once a ping comes through and closes itself after that (good for "playing with settings until it works"), and the continuous version provides some statistics (good for unstable internet connection).
